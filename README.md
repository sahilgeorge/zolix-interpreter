# Zolix-interpreter
Custom made interpreter in python
This is just a custom made interpreter in python.
There are many areas to optimize and many more features to add.
Will try to do it as soon as possible.

Currently has:
 1. Binary to ASCII conversion
 2. Multiple hash function. [More to be added in future]
More features will be added later
